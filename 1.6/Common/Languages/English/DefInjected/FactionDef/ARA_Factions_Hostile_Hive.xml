  <ARA_Hostile_Hive.description>The Arachne hive fleet attempting to invade the Glitterworld was annihilated by the Glitterworld Coalition Forces. Since then, isolated groups of swarm entities stranded within the star system have continued to operate. These swarm individuals have lost connection to the Hive Network and now only possess a low-level intelligence via their autonomously formed, anomalous network, acting like wild beasts. Nevertheless, they remain dangerous enemies, and the genetic reflexes etched across thousands of battles have not dulled their blades.\n\nThey will show no mercy to any being, even their own kind.</ARA_Hostile_Hive.description>
