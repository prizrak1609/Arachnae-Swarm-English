  <ARA_Chrony.label>"Warrior Strain" Chrony</ARA_Chrony.label>
  <ARA_Chrony.description>Chrony is the overseer insect of the Arachne warrior strain. Despite its small size, it's highly aggressive and launches even more powerful, large-scale attacks with each cycle. It also sends fewer visitors and passing wanderers, and will not send the Man In Black even when the colony is on the verge of collapse.</ARA_Chrony.description>
