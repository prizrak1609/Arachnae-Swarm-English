  <ARA_BindDrone.label>Pheromone Tag</ARA_BindDrone.label>
  <ARA_BindDrone.description>Tags an Arachne overseer (including wild swarms) with pheromones. The tagged overseer and its subordinate auxiliaries will pledge loyalty to the Queen and form a mental link.\n\nIn addition to manual linking, the Queen will attempt to automatically link with an untagged Arachne overseer every 60 seconds. Unlike manual linking, this automatic link does not require line of sight.</ARA_BindDrone.description>

  <ARA_Ability_Possess.label>Primal Parasitic Assault</ARA_Ability_Possess.label>
  <ARA_Ability_Possess.description>Leaps at the target, piercing its neural center with a tail needle and replacing it with the Primal's control signals. If the parasitism is successful, the host body is completely taken over and acts as a member of the Arachne Swarm—parasitism fails if the armor cannot be penetrated, but it is guaranteed to succeed on restrained prisoners or incapacitated individuals.\n\nThe parasite requires the Queen's pheromone tag, and the host continues to live like a shell, losing emotions and higher needs. The target's skills and background are replaced by the Primal's. The Primal will escape from the body upon the host's death.</ARA_Ability_Possess.description>
