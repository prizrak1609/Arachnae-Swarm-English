  <ARA_Chrony.description>Chrony is an Arachnae Warrior Drone Overseer. Though small in stature, she is highly aggressive and will launch more powerful, large-scale raids within each cycle. Additionally, she will arrange fewer visitors and passing wanderers, and she will not send the Man in Black when the colony is about to fall.</ARA_Chrony.description>
