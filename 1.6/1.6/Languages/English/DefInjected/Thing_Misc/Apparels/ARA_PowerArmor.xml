  <ARA_Building_SpiderOne.description>A special living structure of the Arachnae Swarm. Although it possesses most of a biological organism's organs, it has no intelligence. It can merge with the overseer drone's nervous system to become equipment similar to power armor. The Symbiotic Muscle provides the host with additional heavy weapons and is equipped with numerous micro-armed organs, allowing the Arachnae insectoid to wield power comparable to a human battle tank.</ARA_Building_SpiderOne.description>
