  <ARA_InsectCreep.description>The ground laid by the Arachnae swarm, mixed with fungi and chitinous secretions, automatically spreads around various Arachnae swarm buildings. This peculiar, dense structure contains numerous hidden nutrient transfer organizations. It can support heavy buildings, allow for crop growth, and accelerate the movement of Arachnae insectoids on it, but no one outside the swarm wants to step on this squishy, living structure.</ARA_InsectCreep.description>
