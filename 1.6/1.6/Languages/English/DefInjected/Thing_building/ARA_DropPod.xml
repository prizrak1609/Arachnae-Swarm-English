  <ARA_DropPod.label>Arachnae Air-Sac Pod</ARA_DropPod.label>
  <ARA_DropPod.description>A gigantic Arachnae drone whose internal cavity can hold large amounts of supplies and insectoids. It uses its body's air sacs to lift off and fly to a destination on the world map, but it self-destructs upon landing. Unlike human drop pods, the air-sac pod does not require fuel and is cheaper to construct.</ARA_DropPod.description>
